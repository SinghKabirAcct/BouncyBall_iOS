# BouncyBall_iOS
A basic bouncy ball video game that runs on iOS

This is a basic iOS app made for an iOS course I'm currently taking.

The app was made using some coded graphics engines.

The controls work like this:
 - drag the barriers to move them
 - tap the funnel to drop the ball
 - tap the ball to reset its position

** The goal of the game is to successfully hit all the goal points using the ball being dropped and movable obstancles

Hope you enjoy!
